## 📍 Overview

This is my solution to the [Pricing Component with Toggle challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pricing-component-with-toggle-8vPwRMIC). The goal was to build a responsive pricing card layout that includes a toggle switch to change between annual and monthly billing.

## ✅ Features

- 🔁 Toggle between **annual** and **monthly** pricing.
- 📱 Fully **responsive layout** for desktop and mobile.
- 🎯 Built with **semantic HTML**, **modern CSS**, and **accessible toggle switch**.
- 💡 Highlighted pricing plan for better visual emphasis.
- ⚡ Clean and reusable CSS with custom properties (CSS variables).

## 🛠️ Built With

- Semantic **HTML5**
- Modern **CSS3** (Flexbox, variables, media queries)
- Minimal **JavaScript** (if dynamic pricing is added)
- [Google Fonts - Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)
